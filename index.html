        <p>Hi! I am an entrepreneur, working on my second stint now. I am building asuper cool product for the GenZs of India.
      Before svitch.it I worked on oneAgrow which was my first venture, I recived funding for oneAgrow in my final year of college.
      That's when my entrepreneurial marathon began. That's all about by work life!
      In the other half of my day, you'll find me learning something new, a laguage (computer or human)!, a skill(technical or creative), or binging on a my thriller collection (sadly a dwindling list)
      I wish to pick up new life skills as I evolve as a human.
      I believe learning never stops and If you stopped learning, there is no better time than right now to put on your student shoes and enjoy the process!
      And if your're happy doing what you are doing, then smile.
      A couple of mantras I try to incorporte within my life.
      Cheers!! ❤</td>
